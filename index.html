                    <p>
                        Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to
                        compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to
                        drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely
                        scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops
                        relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.

                        Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla’s cutting-edge battery technology and electric
                        powertrain. From there, Tesla designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from
                        the ground up – Model S – which has become the best car in its class in every category.
                        Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the world’s expectations for
                        the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air
                        software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28
                        seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with Model X, the
                        safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety
                        ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
                        Completing CEO Elon Musk’s “Secret Master Plan,” in 2016, Tesla introduced Model 3, a
                        low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon after, Tesla
                        unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever – Tesla Semi – which is designed to save owners
                        at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Model
                        Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and Cybertruck, which will have better utility
                        than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car.

                        Tesla vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, and Gigafactory Shanghai. To
                        achieve our goal of having the safest factories in the world, Tesla is taking a proactive
                        approach to safety, requiring production employees to participate in a multi-day training
                        program before ever setting foot on the factory floor. From there, Tesla continues to provide
                        on-the-job training and track performance daily so that improvements can be made quickly. The
                        result is that Tesla’s safety rate continues to improve while production ramps.

                        To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy
                        solutions, Powerwall, Powerpack and Solar Roof, enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities
                        to manage renewable energy generation, storage, and consumption. Supporting Tesla’s automotive
                        and energy products is Gigafactory 1 – a facility designed to significantly reduce battery cell
                        costs. By bringing cell production in-house, Tesla manufactures batteries at the volumes
                        required to meet production goals, while creating thousands of jobs.

                        And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues
                        to make products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the
                        advent of clean transport and clean energy production. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable
                        energy generation and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even
                        more powerful – that’s the future we want.

                        Like every Tesla, Model Y is designed to be the safest vehicle in its class. The low center
                        of gravity, rigid body structure and large crumple zones provide unparalleled protection.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tesla’s Model 3 earned a five-star safety rating from NHTSA in every category, the highest
                        designation available, according to Tesla. The Model 3 also earned a five-star safety rating
                        in Europe’s NCAP safety assessment.</p>
                    <p>Model S, Model X and Model 3 have achieved the lowest overall probability of injury of any
                        vehicle ever tested by the U.S. government’s New Car Assessment Program. Much of this has to
                        do with the rigid, fortified structure of the battery pack that is mounted to a car’s floor,
                        which provides a vehicle with exceptional strength, large crumple zones, and a uniquely low
                        center of gravity.</p>

                    <p>Model Y is fully electric, so you never need to visit a gas station again. If you charge

                        road, it’s easy to plug in along the way—at any public station or with the Tesla charging
